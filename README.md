This web app: **is a simple dashboard that shows a list of video games fetched from an API. You can search games by name and filter them by platform, rating, and release year. The dashboard also shows some basic stats like total games, average rating, and how many games were released recently. Filters update the list instantly as you type or select options. Itâ€™s built with React using hooks like useEffect and useState and makes asynchronous calls to get the data.**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The site has a dashboard displaying a list of data fetched using an API call**
  - The dashboard should display at least 10 unique items, one per row
  - The dashboard includes at least two features in each row
- [x] **`useEffect` React hook and `async`/`await` are used**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data** 
  - The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data, such as:
    -- Total count
    -- Average rating
    -- Count filtered by (year, platform, etc)
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
  - The search bar **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the search query
  - The list of results dynamically updates as the user types into the search bar
- [x] **An additional filter allows the user to restrict displayed items by specified categories**
  - The filter restricts items in the list using a **different attribute** than the search bar 
  - The filter **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the filter attribute in the dashboard
  - The dashboard list dynamically updates as the user adjusts the filter
